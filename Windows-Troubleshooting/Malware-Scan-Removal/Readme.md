2. Executed Microsoft Defender Full Scan
3. Quarantined detected threat
4. Performed secondary scan using Malwarebytes
5. Removed malicious browser extensions
6. Cleared temporary system files
7. Restarted device
8. Reconnected to network
9. Verified system integrity

---

## Verification

After remediation:

- No suspicious processes running
- CPU and memory usage normalized
- No browser pop-ups
- Homepage remained unchanged after reboot
- Follow-up scan returned clean results
- User confirmed performance restored
